back_projection():
  For each x in the grid:
    for each y in the grid:
      sum = 0
      for each scan:
        use pythagorean theorum to find distance from radar to the x, y point
        get scan value, add it to sum
      set the value of (x, y) on the output to be equal to sum
  output the entire matrix of sums
